# Bakery Sales 2024 Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bakery sales for my friend’s family bakery in Pasig. It identifies trends, top-performing items, and customer purchasing behavior to guide strategic decisions in inventory management, staffing, and marketing.

## Problem Statement

Bakery management often faces challenges in understanding which products drive revenue, what times are busiest, and which items underperform. For this project, I helped optimize their best-selling products by analyzing sales data. This analysis investigates:

- Which products generate the most sales and revenue?
- What are the peak days and times for customer purchases?
- How can analyzing sales data help identify opportunities to improve product offerings, staffing, and promotions?

## Methodology

**Data Cleaning & Preparation:**

- Removed duplicates and null values in sales records.
- Categorized products into Bread, Cake, Cookies, and Pastry.
- Calculated metrics like total revenue, total orders, and average order value.

**Analysis & Visualization:**

- Grouped sales by day of the week, time of day, and product category.
- Identified top-selling and least-sold products by revenue and quantity.
- Visualized key metrics through charts and pivot tables for actionable insights.

**Insights Extraction:**

- Focused on understanding peak sales hours, customer preferences, and revenue contributions by product category.

## Key Metrics and KPIs

- **Total Revenue:** Total income generated from all bakery products.
- **Total Orders:** Total number of transactions processed.

## Tools & Technologies

## Key Findings
